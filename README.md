# Iterium 

### Developed by [Made For Gamers](https://mfg.gg)
 
This WebGL Unity game follows a typical arcade genre where you try and survive as long as possible to gain the highest score and be entered on the leaderboard. Score can be achieved by shooting asteroids, collecting Iterium crystals, killing AI ships and Xoid flying Saucers.

The GitHub project was created using the below Unity version and packages. The goal was to keep the project and code as standard as possible without any 3rd party dependencies. The project should work on any 2021.x version and above.

## Unity Project Requirements:

1) Unity version 2021.3.15f1
2) Render Pipeline: URP 12.1.8
3) Input System (new)
4) UI Toolkit
5) Timeline
6) Shader Graph
7) Build platform: WebGL
8) 2 Unity version modules installed, namely WebGL Build Support and Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)

## Unity Project Setup:

1) Create a new repository folder locally from GitHub
2) From the Unity Hub, select to open a project and point the file browser window to the root of the “Asteroid-Unity” folder inside the repository, as example C:\Unity Projects\Iterium-Unity\Asteroid-Unity. 
3) Preferably use the Unity version above to ensure full compatibility and to avoid issues.
4) Once the project opens change the Build Settings to WebGL.
5) Open the MainMenu scene and run the game.
